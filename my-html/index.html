    <p class="heading" style="text-align: center;">Assalamualaikum! I am Umar</p>
    <p>This is my basic html layout which i am going to upload it on github from my office.
        My aim is more higher than this, but for now it's very crucial to have crystal clear concept
        of how github works. Time is 4:50PM and before asr prayer I am going to upload it inshaAllah.
    </p>

        .heading{
            font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;
            letter-spacing: 3px;
            font-size: 28px;
        }
